# Recursion Exercises
👨🏻‍🏫 **Instructor: Homayoun Beheshti -  TA: Ali Montajebi**

For all these problems, be sure to carefully consider your base and recursive cases carefully!

1. Write a function that takes in two numbers and recursively multiplies them together.
2. Write a function that takes in a base and an exp and recursively computes baseexp. You are not allowed to use the ** operator!
3. Write a function using recursion to print numbers from n to 0.
4. Write a function using recursion to print numbers from 0 to n (you just need to change one line in the program of problem 1).
5. Write a function using recursion that takes in a string and returns a reversed copy of the string. The only string operation you are allowed to use is string concatenation.
6. Write a function using recursion to check if a number n is prime (you have to check whether n is divisible by any number below n).
7.  Write a recursive function that takes in one argument n and computes Fn, the nth value of the Fibonacci sequence. Recall that the Fibonacci sequence is defined by the relation


    $$F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$$


    where


    $$F(0) = 0   ,   F(1) = 1$$
