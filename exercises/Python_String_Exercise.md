**Exercise Question 1: Given a string of odd length greater 7, return a string made of the middle three chars of a given String**

```python
getMiddleThreeChars("JhonDipPeta") ‚Üí "Dip"
getMiddleThreeChars("Jasonay") ‚Üí "son"
```

Expected Output:

    Original String is JhonDipPeta
    Middle three chars are Dip
    Original String is Jasonay
    Middle three chars are son

**Exercise Question 2: Given 2 strings, s1 and s2, create a new string by appending s2 in the middle of s1**

Expected Outcome:

```python
appendMiddle("Chrisdem", IamNewString) ‚Üí "ChrIamNewStringisdem"
```

**Exercise Question 3: Given 2 strings, s1, and s2 return a new string made of the first, middle and last char each input string**

Expected Outcome:

```python
mixString("America", "Japan") = ""AJrpan"
```

**Exercise Question 4: arrange String characters such that lowercase letters should come first**
Given input String of combination of the lower and upper case arrange characters in such a way that all lowercase letters should come first.
Expected Output:

```python
input_String = PyNaTive
arranging characters giving precedence to lowercase letters
aeiNPTvy

arranging characters giving precedence to lowercase letters:
yaivePNT
```

**Exercise Question 5: Given a string input Count all lower case, upper case, digits, and special symbols**

Expected Outcome:

```python
input_str = "P@#yn26at^&i5ve"
```

    Total counts of chars, digits,and symbols Chars = 8 Digits = 3 Symbol = 4

**Exercise Question 6: Given two strings, s1 and s2, create a mixed String**
**Note**: create a third-string made of the first char of the last char of b, the second char of the second last char of b, and so on. Any leftover chars go at the end of the result.

Expected Outcome:

    mixString("Pynative", "Website") = PeytniastbievWe

**Exercise Question 7: String characters balance Test**
We‚Äôll say that a String s1 and s2 is balanced if all the chars in the string1 are there in s2. characters position doesn‚Äôt matter.
For Example: ‚Äì

```python
stringBalanceCheck(yn, Pynative) = True
```

**Exercise Question 8: Find all occurrences of ‚ÄúUSA‚Äù in given string ignoring the case**
Expected Outcome:

```python

input_str = "Welcome to IRAN. iran awesome, isn't it?"

The IRAN count is: 2
```

**Exercise Question 9: Given a string, return the sum and average of the digits that appear in the string, ignoring all other characters**
For Example: ‚Äì

```python
sumAndAverage("English = 78 Science = 83 Math = 68 History = 65") = sum 294 Percentage is 73.5
```

**Exercise Question 10: Given an input string, count occurrences of all characters within a string**
For Example:

```python
count("pynativepynvepynative") = {'p': 3, 'y': 3, 'n': 3, 'a': 2, 't': 2, 'i': 2, 'v': 3, 'e': 3}
```
