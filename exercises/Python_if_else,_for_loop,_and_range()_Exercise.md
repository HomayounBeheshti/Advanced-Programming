üë®üèª‚Äçüè´ **Instructor: Homayoun Beheshti - TA: Ali Montajebi**

**Exercise Question 1: Print First 10 natural numbers using while loop**
**Expected output:**

```python
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5
    6
    7
    8
    9
    10
```

**Exercise Question 2: Print the following pattern**

```python
    1
    1 2
    1 2 3
    1 2 3 4
    1 2 3 4 5
```

**Exercise Question 3: Accept n number from user and calculate the sum of all number between 1 and n including n**

For example user given **10** so the output should be **55**

**Exercise Question 4: Accept n number from user and print its multiplication table**
For example user given 2 so the output should be

```python
    2
    4
    6
    8
    10
    12
    14
    16
    18
    20
```

**Exercise Question 5: Given a list iterate it and display numbers which are divisible by 5 and if you find number greater than 150 stop the loop iteration**

```python
    list1 = [12, 15, 32, 42, 55, 75, 122, 132, 150, 180, 200]
```

**Expected output:**

```python
    15
    55
    75
    150
```

**Exercise Question 6: Given a number count the total number of digits in a number**
For example, the number is **75869**, so the output should be **5**.

**Exercise Question 7: Print the following pattern using for loop**

```python
    5 4 3 2 1
    4 3 2 1
    3 2 1
    2 1
    1
```

**Exercise Question 8: Reverse the following list using for loop**

```python
    list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```

**Expected output:**

```python
    50
    40
    30
    20
    10
```

**Exercise Question 9: Display -10 to -1 using for loop**

**Expected output:**

```python
    -10
    -9
    -8
    -7
    -6
    -5
    -4
    -3
    -2
    -1
```

**Exercise Question 10: Display a message ‚ÄúDone‚Äù after successful execution of for loop**
For example, the following loop will execute without any error.

```python
    for i in range(5):
        print(i)
```

So the **Expected output should be:**

```python
    0
    1
    2
    3
    4
    Done!
```
