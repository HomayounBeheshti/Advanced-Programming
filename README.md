# Advanced programming course

This Python tutorial was created for advanced programming course for computer students. In this lesson, I want to talk about simple topics to advanced topics in programming with Python. Python is one of the most powerful programming languages in the world. Today, this powerful language has become one of the top tools for developing web and mobile applications, artificial intelligence applications, especially machine learning, and big data analytics. Python's remarkable success is due to the valuable features it offers to both professional and beginner developers.

In this course, we will cover topics such as Python data structure, functions, modules, file storage and retrieval, exception handling, object-oriented programming, and many other advanced topics. Students who take this course should know that there are many job opportunities for Python programming professionals today, and that this good job market will undoubtedly become more visible in the future, given the growing popularity of the language.
